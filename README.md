<h1>Report: Bank Web Service</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This report provides a detailed overview of the "Bank Web Service" project, which was developed to demonstrate the capabilities of modern web service technologies. The service facilitates various banking operations via a SOAP-based interface, including currency conversion and account management. The project showcases the application of XML web services in real-world scenarios, enhancing understanding of both client and server-side implementations.</p>

  <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>The project is organized into several packages and modules, detailing the server side as well as the generated SOAP client:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ma.enset</strong>: Contains the main classes of the server project.</li>
        <li><strong>ma.enset.BankService</strong>: Service class exposing the operations of the bank.</li>
        <li><strong>ma.enset.Account</strong>: Model class for bank accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>ma.enset.ServerJWS</strong>: Class to start the JAX-WS server.</li>
        <li><strong>client-SOAP-java</strong>: Client project containing the generated stub and access classes for the service.</li>
        <li><strong>proxy</strong>: Automatically generated folder containing the stubs and other classes necessary for interacting with the web service. This folder includes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>BankService</code> and <code>BanqueWS</code>: Stub classes for the web service.</li>
            <li><code>Account</code>, <code>AccountList</code>, <code>AccountListResponse</code>: Classes to manage account information.</li>
            <li><code>ConversionEuroToDH</code>, <code>ConversionEuroToDHResponse</code>: Classes for currency conversion.</li>
            <li><code>GetAccount</code>, <code>GetAccountResponse</code>: Classes to retrieve the details of an account.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

  <h2>Web Service Features</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Currency Conversion (<code>conversion</code>)</strong>: Converts an amount from Euro to DH. The conversion uses a predefined exchange rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Inquiry (<code>getAccount</code>)</strong>: Allows retrieval of specific account information by its identifier.</li>
        <li><strong>Account List Inquiry (<code>accountList</code>)</strong>: Provides a list of all available accounts with their details.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Execution and Deployment</h2>
    <p>The JAX-WS server is started via the <code>ma.enset.ServerJWS</code> class, exposing the service at <code>http://localhost:9090/bankService</code>. The SOAP client can interact with the service using the classes generated in the <code>proxy</code> folder.</p>

  <h2>Consultation and Analysis of the WSDL</h2>
    <p>The WSDL generated by the service can be consulted at the URL <code>http://localhost:9090/bankService?wsdl</code>. This WSDL interface allows developers to understand and interact with the service without direct access to the server code.</p>

  <h2>Testing the Operations</h2>
    <p>The operations of the web service can be tested using tools such as SoapUI or Postman for SOAP by loading the WSDL and sending requests to the different operations exposed.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project successfully demonstrates the implementation and functionality of a SOAP-based web service using JAX-WS. The service efficiently handles various banking operations, offering a robust example of web service integration in enterprise applications. Moving forward, this project could be expanded to include more complex banking operations, incorporate additional security measures, and enhance scalability by integrating microservices architecture.</p>
